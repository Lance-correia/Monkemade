Things im planning to do in my homeserver…..

my current plans to make a server include that it has a kubernetes cluster that has a bunch of my services that are routed to the open internet using cloudflare tunnels.

- 4 raspi with 1 controller node and 3 nodes.
- use all the storage that i already have.

what do i plan to achieve from this:

- im POOR…so hopefully save cloud vps costs by spending more in electricity bills.
- learn about everything:
    - hosting
    - networking
    - infrastructure
    - ports
    - ipv4 / ipv6
    - docker, kubernetes, clustering
- have control over my server and own the data
- run a media server so i can control my content
- find an alternative to google photos cos the free 15gb is used and over for more than 3 years now and all of my photos are locally saved.

Things i will need to buy to be able to achieve it.

- at least 3 raspberry pi 4s so that i can run the kubernetes cluster
- a gigabit switch so its actually fast and doesnt run like a potato
- power for everything
- rack(hopefully fully 3d printed)
